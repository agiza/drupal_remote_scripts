# DruPerms

DruPerms is a collection of scripts designed to help with managing file permissions for a Drupal site on a remote server.

## Prerequisites

These scripts assume that your public, private and temporary files directories are outside of version control. Changing the permissions of files *in* version control may affect Git status and will lead to possible complications.
